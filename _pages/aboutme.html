<p style="font-size: 19px;">
I am a PhD student studying cognitive psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I work in the 
<a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/benjaminlab/">Human Memory and Cognition lab</a>, under the supervision 
of Dr. Aaron Benjamin. My work sits at the intersection of perception, metacognition, and decision-making, with 
a particular focus on how metacognitive control shapes behavior over time. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px;">
I use an integrative approach that combines behavioral experiments, psychophysics, eye-tracking, physiological measures, 
and computational modeling. Across projects, I am especially interested in understanding not just what decisions people 
make, but how they regulate their behavior in response to uncertainty, task demands, and internal feedback. To this end, 
I frequently employ modeling frameworks such as signal detection theory, drift-diffusion models, item response theory, and 
hierarchical Bayesian methods to formalize latent cognitive processes.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px;">
Beyond theory, I am motivated by applications of cognitive science to human–computer interaction and user experience research. 
I am passionate about translating insights from perception and decision-making into the design of digital systems that are 
more intuitive, adaptive, and aligned with human cognitive constraints. This perspective informs my interest in UX research, 
data science, and applied experimental design.

    My training as a quantitative cognitive psychologist emphasizes rigorous data analysis, modeling, and experimental design. 
	I regularly work with complex, noisy behavioral and physiological datasets and translate them into interpretable, actionable insights.
